# form create

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/tanyildiz/pen/rNBbOWp](https://codepen.io/tanyildiz/pen/rNBbOWp).

This is a predefined table creator. For example, if there is a need like some title, date etc which belongs to an activity, it may be used in the back and completing the missing links, the infos in the table can be saved to web page.

I adapted the code from https://www.encodedna.com/javascript/dynamically-add-remove-rows-to-html-table-using-javascript-and-save-data.htm.
